# DemoVideos
In this repository, videos have been added to showcase my work on Cognitive Robotics and Autonomous Navigation.

## Autonomous Navigation and Out-of-stock Detecion
Design and implementation of a system capable of autonomously moving inside a supermarket. The purpose of the system is to navigate inside the supermarket, build a map of the environment, move autonomously inside it without disturbing the people present, and identify empty shelves and notify the staff.

## Autonomous Navigation with Turtlebot 3
The aim of the system is to move autonomously in the environment. Given the map and a starting point, the robot must reach the final goal by following a series of waypoints. The experiment is run both in real (on the left) and in simulation (on the right).

## Map building
The video demonstrates the process of building a map of a portion of the DIEM Department at the University of Salerno using a Turtlebot 3. The robot is tele-operated by the user, and the SLAM algorithm Cartographer is executed to create the map.

## Speech Command Recognition
The aim of this work is to realize a human-machine interaction system based on speech commands. The system must be able to recognize a predefined set of commands and must be able to work in real industrial scenarios, so it must run in real-time and must be robust to any perturbations presented in the environment. The video demo is available only in Italian.
